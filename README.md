There are two boxes, the first is A₁ × B₁ × C₁, the second is A₂ × B₂ × C₂. Determine whether one of these boxes can be placed inside 
the other, provided that the boxes can only be rotated 90 degrees around the ribs.

Input format

The program receives the numbers A₁, B₁, C₁, A₂, B₂, C₂ as input.

Output format

The program should print one of the following lines:

Boxes are equal, if the boxes are the same,

The first box is smaller than the second one, if the first box can be put in the second,

The first box is larger than the second one, if the second box can be put in the first,
